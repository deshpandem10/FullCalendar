# FullCalendar Scheduler 

This repo gives overview on FullCalendar API implementation and an extention to it to schedule a task or event on any particular date.

The project allows user to create tasks on a date clicked on calendar, have list of all tasks for that particular date and move the 
scheduled tasks from one date to another date by dragging and dropping.

The task/event creation on past dates is not allowed, alert is thrown in that case. Overlapping in time of tasks having same participant 
is not permitted, alert is thrown.
